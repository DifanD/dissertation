Four folders are in this repository: Data Loading & Pre-processing, Database, Modeling and Production_pipeline

## Data Loading & Pre-processing
The notebook consists of final techniques to download PDF files from sharepoint, to perform filerting, document classification, image pre-processing, OCR (Tesseract & pix2struct), and to upload back to sharepoint.
Different techniques were experimented for each transformation task, but only the best output is in the notebook for succinctness. 

## Modeling
The folder consists all model experimented in this project, including Deep-learning models, Set-Fit models, Adatper-transformer models, and
Data Augmentation models. Synthetic data generated by Data Augmentation models is also included in the folder. Moreover, it includes a notebook 
named 'Model_data_loading', which consists of the best text pre-processing techniques after experimentation on training data. 

## Production_pipeline
The folder contains individual classificaiton notebooks from the first and second stage classification models to predict labels from an unseen lease
text file. The 'Post_classification_transformation" is the transformation apply to the outputs from those models. The notebook "Final_production_pipeline"
is the final_pipeline which will transform the text file into a table that can be written into the database

## Database
This folder consists the schema for the proejct. Docker folder will be passed to the company not avialable in public
