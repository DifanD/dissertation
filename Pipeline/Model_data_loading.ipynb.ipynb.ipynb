Rent suspension \\n\\n4.1 Subject to paragraph 4.2 of this Schedule, if any Property Damage by an Insured \\nRisk or an Uninsured Risk occurs, payment of the Annual Rent (or a fair proportion of \\nit according to the nature and extent of that Property Damage) shall be suspended \\nuntil the earlier of: \\n\\n4.1.1 the date on which the Property has been reinstated so that it is fit for \\noccupation and use; and \\n\\n4.1.2 the date which is three years from and including the date on which that \\nProperty Damage occurred. \\n\\n4.2 The Annual Rent shall not be suspended under paragraph 4.1 of this Schedule if the \\nProperty Damage is caused by: \\n\\n4.2.1 an Insured Risk and: \\n\\n4.2.1.1 the policy of insurance in relation to the Property has been \\nvitiated in whole or in part as a result of any act or omission of \\nthe Tenant or any Authorised Person; and \\n\\n4.2.1.2 the Tenant has not complied with clause 3.2.6 of this \\nSchedule; or \\n\\n4.2.2 an Uninsured Risk and the Property Damage was Tenant Damage. \\n\\n5. Landlord’s obligation to reinstate following damage or destruction by an \\nInsured Risk \\n\\n5.1 Following any damage to or destruction of the Property by an Insured Risk, the \\nLandlord must: \\n\\n5.1.1 use reasonable endeavours to obtain all necessary planning and other \\nconsents to enable the Landlord to reinstate the Property; and \\n\\n5.1.2 reinstate the Property except that the Landlord shall not be obliged to: \\n\\n5.1.2.1 reinstate unless all necessary planning and other consents are \\nobtained; \\n\\n5.1.2.2 reinstate unless and until the Tenant has paid the sums due \\nunder clause 3.1.2 and clause 3.2.6 of this Schedule; \\n\\n5.1.2.3 provide accommodation or facilities identical in layout or \\ndesign so long as accommodation reasonably equivalent to \\nthat previously at the Property; or \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n51 \\n\\n5.1.2.4 reinstate after a valid notice to terminate has been served \\npursuant to this the Sixth Schedule, the effect of which is to \\nend this Lease. \\n\\n5.2 If the Landlord is obliged to reinstate the Property pursuant to clause 5.1.2 of this \\nSchedule, the Landlord must: \\n\\n5.2.1 do so as soon as reasonably practicable; \\n\\n5.2.2 use all insurance money received (other than for loss of rent) and all sums \\nreceived under clause 3.1.2 and clause 3.2.6 of this Schedule for the \\npurposes of that reinstatement; and \\n\\n5.2.3 make up any shortfall out of its own funds. \\n\\n6. Termination if reinstatement impossible or impractical following Property \\nDamage by an Insured Risk \\n\\nFollowing Property Damage by an Insured Risk, if the Landlord (acting reasonably) \\nconsiders that it is impossible or impractical to reinstate the Property, the Landlord \\nmay terminate this Lease by giving notice to the Tenant within six months from and \\nincluding the date on which that Property Damage occurred. \\n\\n7. Property Damage by an Uninsured Risk \\n\\n7.1 If the Annual Rent (or a fair proportion of it) is suspended under paragraph 4.1 of this \\nSchedule due to Property Damage by an Uninsured Risk, then, within 12 months \\nfrom and including the date on which that Property Damage occurred, the Landlord \\nmust either: \\n\\n7.1.1 notify the Tenant that it intends to reinstate the Property at its own cost; or \\n\\n7.1.2 notify the Tenant that it does not intend to reinstate the Property at its own \\ncost, in which event this Lease will terminate on the date that is three \\nmonths after the date of the Landlord’s notice to the Tenant. \\n\\n7.2 If the Landlord notifies the Tenant under clause 7.1.1 that it intends to reinstate the \\nProperty, then the Landlord must use: \\n\\n7.2.1 reasonable endeavours to obtain all necessary planning and other \\nconsents to enable the Landlord to reinstate the Property; and \\n\\n7.2.2 its own monies to reinstate the Property but the Landlord shall not be \\nobliged to: \\n\\n7.2.2.1 reinstate unless all necessary planning and other consents are \\nobtained; \\n\\n7.2.2.2 provide accommodation or facilities identical in layout or \\ndesign so long as accommodation reasonably equivalent to \\nthat previously at the Property; or \\n\\n7.2.2.3 reinstate after a notice to terminate has been served pursuant \\nto this the Sixth Schedule. \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n52 \\n\\n7.3 If paragraph 7.1 applies but the Landlord has not served a notice under either clause \\n7.1.1 or clause 7.1.2 by the date which is 12 months from and including the date on \\nwhich the relevant Property Damage occurred, the Tenant may at any time thereafter \\nterminate this Lease by giving notice to the Landlord provided that such notice is \\nserved before the Property is made fit for occupation and use. \\n\\n8. Termination if reinstatement not completed by expiry of rent suspension \\n\\n8.1 If Property Damage by an Insured Risk or an Uninsured Risk (where the Landlord \\nelected to reinstate under clause 7.1.1 of this Schedule) occurs and the Property has \\nnot been reinstated so as to make it fit for occupation and use by the date which is \\nthree years after the date on which that Property Damage occurred, either party may \\nat any time thereafter terminate this Lease by giving notice to the other provided that: \\n\\n8.1.1 such notice is served before the Property has been reinstated so as to \\nmake it fit for occupation and use; and \\n\\n8.1.2 where the Tenant serves the notice, the failure to reinstate so that the \\nProperty is fit for occupation and use is not caused by a breach of the \\nTenant’s obligations under this Sixth Schedule. \\n\\n9. Consequences of termination \\n\\n9.1 If either party gives a notice to terminate this Lease in accordance with this the Sixth \\nSchedule: \\n\\n9.1.1 this Lease shall terminate with immediate effect from the date of the \\nnotice; \\n\\n9.1.2 none of the parties shall have any further rights or obligations under this \\nLease except for the rights of any party in respect of any earlier breach of \\nthis Lease; and \\n\\n9.1.3 any proceeds of the insurance for the Property shall belong to the \\nLandlord. \\n\\n10. Tenant Damage \\n\\n10.1 If any damage to or destruction of the Property by an Uninsured Risk is caused by \\nTenant Damage, the Landlord shall not be obliged to reinstate such damage to the \\nProperty but if the Landlord chooses to do so, the Tenant must pay within 15 working \\ndays of written demand all costs reasonably and properly incurred by the Landlord in \\nreinstating. \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n53 \\n\\nTHE SEVENTH SCHEDULE \\nGuarantee  \\n\\n1.

PERFORMANCE, DESIGN AND REVIEW \\nINFORMATION \\n\\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n\\nINTRODUCTION \\n\\nThe works, as indicated in the specification and on the tender drawings, comprise the \\nmechanical engineering services and utilities to serve the construction of Proposed CAT A \\nOffice Development at Fenlake House. \\n\\nThis specification and the accompanying Schedule of Mechanical Manufacturers (separate \\ndocument) describes the scope of the mechanical engineering services and sets out the \\nperformance required for the systems in operation. \\n\\nEngineering Services Consultancy Limited have provided indicative drawings of the general \\nlayout and services requirements to illustrate the design intent. The Mechanical Contractor is \\nresponsible for designing, supplying, installing, testing and commissioning all the mechanical \\nservices as described within this specification. \\n\\n \\n\\nTHE SPECIFICATION \\n\\nThis specification requires compliance with Statutory legislation and recognised UK standards \\n(such as British Standards, CIBSE, BSRIA, BESA and Approved Documents for Building \\nRegulations) and including all ‘tiered’ documents referred to within these standards and \\nguides. The Contractor is to utilise these standards on which to base the development of the \\ndesign.  \\n\\nEach system/engineering service has its own dedicated section within this mechanical \\nperformance specification. The specification and design intent drawings describe the design \\nphilosophy/servicing strategy for the engineering services approved by the Employer, \\nincluding main distribution routes of systems. These are the minimum provisions; the \\nContractor is not permitted to deviate away from the design philosophy/servicing strategy \\nunder any circumstances. \\n\\nIt is accepted that minor deviations may occur due to final site coordination or changes to the \\nbuilding design approved by the Employer. All deviations must be reported to the Employer’s \\nConsultant for review before works progress on site. \\n\\nPlant and equipment sizes/loads provided in the specification and/or design intent drawings \\nare for information only to assist during the tender stage and may comprise approximations \\nand estimates of such. The Contractor is required to undertake their own detailed design \\ncalculations to satisfy themselves with the equipment proposals. \\n\\nWhen the specification does not provide a specific requirement, or the design or installation \\nrequirements are not covered by any of the quoted standards, the Contractor shall contact the \\nEmployer’s Consultant to agree a solution. \\n\\nTo provide the Contractor with design flexibility, more than one type of material/ manufacturer \\nmay be permitted for use. However, only one material should be utilised for each element of \\nany given system. For example, pipework should be entirely press-fit copper for domestic \\nwater services. A mixture of materials in the same system is not acceptable.  \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\nwww.escuk.com \\n1632/ESC/CA/ZZ/SP/M/0002 \\n\\nESC1632 - PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES – T1  \\n19/02/2021 - PROPOSED CAT A OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AT FENLAKE HOUSE - GRAFTONGATE Page 4 of 39 \\n\\n \\n\\nDESIGN APPROACH AND STRATEGY \\n\\nAll works shall be executed in accordance with; \\n\\na.

Any regulations, orders, byelaws or codes of practice of any local or statutory authority \\nor statutory undertaker having jurisdiction over the Works \\n\\nd. British and/or European Standards and Codes of Practice. \\n\\nThe principles of ‘best practice’ will be applied wherever possible throughout the design \\nprocess, to provide a facility that balances performance with operational cost.  Best practice \\nshould utilise known technology and modern design and process management techniques to \\nproduce systems that operate within sensible parameters, without excessive margins that \\nresult in over-design and poor performance. \\n\\n \\n\\nDESIGN STANDARDS \\n\\nThe Mechanical and Electrical services are to be designed, supplied, installed, tested and \\ncommissioned in accordance with the following standards: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 British Standards, where relevant to Building Services \\n\\n\\uf0b7 International Standards, where harmonised with British Standards \\n\\n\\uf0b7 BSRIA Guides and Technical Memoranda \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Design Guides \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Technical Memoranda \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Application Manuals \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Building Engineering Services Association \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Statutory Regulations and Instruments \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Clean Air Act \\n\\n\\uf0b7 WRAS \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Health and Safety Executive (HSE) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturers recommendations \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Heating and Ventilation Contractors Association \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Gas Safe Regulations \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Institute of Refrigeration \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Electricity at Work Regulations \\n\\n  \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\nwww.escuk.com \\n1632/ESC/CA/ZZ/SP/M/0002 \\n\\nESC1632 - PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES – T1  \\n19/02/2021 - PROPOSED CAT A OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AT FENLAKE HOUSE - GRAFTONGATE Page 5 of 39 \\n\\n \\n\\nMANUFACTURERS SCHEDULE \\n\\nThe Schedule of Mechanical Manufacturers, which is a separate document, shall be read in \\nconjunction with this specification. \\n\\nUnless specifically stated as otherwise, any reference to specific manufacturers, products \\nand\\\\or suppliers is made to establish a minimum acceptable level of quality.

For air conditioned buildings, summer and winter operative temperature ranges in \\noccupied spaces are in accordance with the criteria set out in CIBSE Guide A \\nEnvironmental design, Table 1.5; or other appropriate industry standard (where this \\nsets a higher or more appropriate requirement/level for the building type). \\n\\nb. For naturally ventilated/free running buildings: \\ni. Winter operative temperature ranges in occupied spaces are in accordance \\n\\nwith the criteria set out in CIBSE Guide A Environmental design, Table 1.5; or \\nother appropriate industry standard (where this sets a higher or more \\nappropriate requirement/level for the building type). \\n\\nii. The building is designed to limit the risk of overheating, in accordance with the \\nadaptive comfort methodology outlined in CIBSE TM52: The limits of thermal \\ncomfort: avoiding overheating in European buildings. \\n\\nFor air conditioned buildings, the PMV (predicted mean vote) and PPD (predicted percentage \\nof dissatisfied) indices based on the above modelling are reported via the BREEAM \\nassessment scoring and reporting tool. \\n\\n \\n\\nADAPTABILITY - FOR A PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO \\n\\nThe thermal modelling demonstrates that the relevant requirements set out in criterion 3 are \\nachieved for a projected climate change environment. \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\nwww.escuk.com \\n1632/ESC/CA/ZZ/SP/M/0002 \\n\\nESC1632 - PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES – T1  \\n19/02/2021 - PROPOSED CAT A OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AT FENLAKE HOUSE - GRAFTONGATE Page 12 of 39 \\n\\n \\n\\nWhere thermal comfort criteria are not met for the projected climate change environment, the \\nproject team demonstrates how the building has been adapted, or designed to be easily \\nadapted in future using passive design solutions in order to subsequently meet the above \\nrequirements. \\n\\nFor air conditioned buildings, the PMV and PPD indices based on the above modelling are \\nreported. \\n\\n \\n\\nTHERMAL ZONING AND CONTROLS \\n\\nThe thermal modelling criteria are achieved.  \\n\\nThe thermal modelling analysis (criteria1 on the previous page to 4 on the previous page) has \\ninformed the temperature control strategy for the building and its users. \\n\\nThe strategy for proposed heating or cooling systems demonstrates that it has addressed the \\nfollowing: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Zones within the building, and how the building services could efficiently and \\nappropriately heat or cool these areas. For example, consider the different \\nrequirements for the central core of a building compared with the external perimeter \\nadjacent to the windows. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The degree of occupant control required for these zones. This is based on discussions \\nwith the end user (or alternatively building type or use specific design guidance, case \\nstudies, feedback) and considers: \\n\\no User knowledge of building services. \\n\\no Occupancy type, patterns and room functions (and therefore appropriate level \\nof control required). \\n\\no How the user is likely to operate or interact with the systems, e.g. are they likely \\nto open windows, access thermostatic radiator valves (TRV) on radiators, \\nchange air-conditioning settings etc. \\n\\no The user expectations (this may differ in the summer and winter) and degree \\nof individual control (i.e. obtaining the balance between occupant preferences, \\nfor example some occupants like fresh air and others dislike draughts). \\n\\n\\uf0b7 How the proposed systems will interact with each other (where there is more than one \\nsystem) and how this may affect the thermal comfort of the building occupants. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The need or otherwise for an accessible building user actuated manual override for \\nany automatic systems. \\n\\n \\n\\nENE 01 REDUCTION OF ENERGY USE AND CARBON \\n\\nA minimum of 4 credits must be achieved.

DISPOSAL SYSTEMS \\n\\nABOVE GROUND WASTEWATER DRAINAGE SYSTEMS \\n\\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION  \\n\\nThe Mechanical Contractor shall design, supply, install and commission in its entirety the \\ncomplete above ground foul drainage systems to serve the sanitary appliances shown on the \\nArchitect\\'s drawings. Any below ground drainage shall be provided by others. This \\nspecification shall be read in conjunction with the below ground drainage drawings so the \\nMechanical Contractor understands where his works finish, and the Civil Engineer’s works \\ncommence. \\n\\nThe above ground drainage system shall safely remove black and grey (foul) water from all \\nsanitary appliances, in a quick, quiet and unobtrusive manner, discharging into the below \\nground drainage system, without risk of injury to health and without escape of foul air into the \\nbuilding.  \\n\\nThe Mechanical Contractor is responsible for making all final connections into the below \\nground drainage system and all appliances throughout the building. \\n\\nThe drainage systems shall comprise vertical stacks of minimum 110mm diameter. This is to \\nminimise blockages experienced with stacks of smaller diameter and provide for future \\nexpansion/modification.  The stacks shall be complete with suitable rodding/access locations \\nto both vertical stacks and horizontal runs.  Locations of these points shall be agreed with the \\nArchitect and the Engineer, to ensure appropriate access is achieved throughout the system.  \\n\\nDue consideration shall be given where IPS boxings/voids are utilised, whereby the rodding \\naccess could be restricted by the proximity of adjacent walls etc. Rodding access points shall \\nbe provided by extending the horizontal stack vertically at the end of the run. \\n\\nSoil Vent Pipes (SVP) shall be ventilated to atmosphere, where necessary, to reduce the \\nnumber of roof penetrations stacks which are in close proximity. The system can have the dry \\nsections of the stacks connected together before terminating through the roof. The dry section \\nof the stack shall be taken to a suitable part of the roof and discreetly terminated via ridge \\nvents or tile vents. \\n\\nThe use of Automatic Air Vents (AAV’s) with BBA Certification can be used to reduce the \\nnumber of roof penetrations, however, the head of the drainage system must to be ventilated \\nto atmosphere in line with current British Standards. \\n\\nDrainage shall be provided to internal plant room areas and refuse stores via a floor gully. If \\nthe floor gulley is to be used for the discharge of hot water from safety/expansion valves the \\ndrainage pipework and the SVP material shall be suitable for handling water continuously at \\n100°C.

PREAMBLE TO THE PERFORMANCE \\n\\nSPECIFICATION \\n\\n1.1 PROJECT PARTICULARS \\n\\nThe Preamble is an introduction to the Performance Specifications for the Mechanical and \\n\\nElectrical Engineering Services (the Specifications), which sets out additional requirements \\n\\nthe Contractor is obliged to fulfil. The Preamble shall be read in conjunction with all contract \\n\\ndocuments, including but not limited to the, design intent drawings, the Particular Specification \\n\\nfor Mechanical Services, the Particular Specification for Electrical Services, the Schedule of \\n\\nMechanical Manufacturers, the Schedule of Electrical Manufacturers, and the Main Contract \\n\\npreliminaries. The specification and related documentation provide details of the required \\n\\nperformance, workmanship, materials standards and design intent of the engineering \\n\\nservices. \\n\\nThe specification refers to a single Contractor only. Therefore, should the Contractor split the \\n\\nspecified works into separate packages and employ the services of Sub-Contractors, the \\n\\nContractor is responsible for explicitly defining the role of each of the Sub-Contractors and \\n\\ncoordinating their works accordingly. \\n\\nThe Contractor shall notify the Contract Administrator if they do not understand any aspects \\n\\nof the specification, or if they believe discrepancies exist within. In such circumstances, the \\n\\nContract Administrator shall liaise with the Employer’s Consultant as required. \\n\\n \\n\\nBRIEF PROJECT OUTLINE \\n\\nThe new development shall comprise the MEP engineering services and utilities to serve the \\n\\nconstruction of a new 3 storey office building with partial shell area on the ground floor area.  \\n\\nThe building shall be energy efficient and secure, simple to operate at a basic level and built \\n\\nto high standards of workmanship with high quality materials. \\n\\n \\n\\nTHE ROLE OF THE EMPLOYER’S CONSULTANT \\n\\nAs the Employer’s Consultant, Engineering Services Consultancy (ESC) will undertake a \\n\\nmonitoring role on behalf of the Employer (Graftongate) to see that the Contractor’s design \\n\\nand installation works are in accordance with the Employer’s Requirements. ESC will advise \\n\\nthe Client throughout the Construction and post-Construction phases of the project. ESC does \\n\\nnot carry out a design co-ordination role, nor does it ‘approve’ or otherwise endorse any \\n\\nspecific course of action put to it in anyway by the Contractor. Its role is to advise the Employer \\n\\nonly of the adequacy of the Contractor’s works against the Employer’s Requirements. \\n\\nPrior to the commencement of installation works on site, the role of the Employer’s Consultant \\n\\nwill be to review all Contractor proposals and report its findings to the Employer only. Once \\n\\ninstallation works begin on site, the role of the Employer’s Consultant will be to inspect \\n\\ninstallations for good workmanship and compliance with the Specification, and to witness the \\n\\ncommissioned engineering services, all on behalf of the Client.  \\n\\nIf at any stage during the project the Employer’s Consultant identifies that the Contractor’s \\n\\nproposals or installations deviate away from the Specification, it will issue a non-compliance \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\nhttp://www.escuk.com/\\nhttp://www.escuk.com/\\n\\n\\nwww.escuk.com \\n\\n1632-ESC-CA-ZZ-SP-Z-0001 \\n\\nESC1632 - PREAMBLES FOR MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES – T1  \\n\\n19/02/2021 - PROPOSED CAT A OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AT FENLAKE HOUSE - GRAFTONGATE Page 4 of 30 \\n\\n \\n\\nnotification to the Employer via the Contract Administrator. Under such circumstances, the \\n\\nContractor will be required to respond to the notice and undertake all necessary changes and \\n\\nprovide compliant systems entirely at their own cost, whilst not causing delay to the \\n\\nconstruction programme.  \\n\\nThe Employer’s Consultant will not authorise any changes to the Specification unless \\n\\ninstructed to do so by the Employer. Should the Contractor wish to vary the requirements of \\n\\nthe Specification or any other Contract documents, a Request for Change or Variation Request \\n\\nmust be submitted for consideration by the Employer’s Consultant. Any instructions to vary \\n\\nthe Employer’s Requirements will be issued by the Contract Administrator.  \\n\\nWhen the Employer’s Consultant is called to site by the Contractor to undertake inspection of \\n\\nthe works, or to witness the commissioned engineering services, all offered works must be \\n\\n100% complete, of good quality and fully compliant with the Employer’s Requirements. If the \\n\\nworks are not found to be satisfactory and the inspection visit must be repeated, the \\n\\nEmployer’s Consultant will recover all costs incurred for the additional time spent from \\n\\nthe Contractor via the Employer through the contract. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the Works are delayed through the actions of the Contractor, the Employer’s \\n\\nConsultant will recover all costs incurred for the additional time spent from the Contractor via \\n\\nthe Employer through the contract. \\n\\nNo approvals, comments, instructions, consents or advice or indication of satisfaction given \\n\\nby or from ESC, nor any enquiry or inspection which ESC may make or have carried out for \\n\\nits benefit or on its behalf shall operate to reduce, extinguish, exclude, limit or modify the \\n\\nContractor’s obligation to fulfil its duties and obligations under the Contract. Any amendment \\n\\nto the Contract will be issued by the Employer’s Representative in accordance with the terms \\n\\nof the Contract.  \\n\\n \\n\\nDEFINITIONS  \\n\\nTerm Definition \\n\\nCommissioning \\nThe setting to work of engineering services to operate within the \\n\\nspecified parameters using the least amount of energy possible. \\n\\nContract Administrator The Employer’s elected representative. \\n\\nDesign intent drawing \\n\\nThe Employer’s Consultant’s drawings which detail the location of \\n\\nplant, equipment, ancillaries, terminal units and main service routes \\n\\napproved by the Employer.

Sarnavap HD (heavy duty) SA is a self-adhesive air vapour control layer,\\nmade of polymer modified bitumen, sand finished with an aluminium composite and glass\\ncombination inlay. When installing carefully peel away the PE-LD release liner, ensuring the full surface\\narea is pressed into place immediately after adhering, using a water filled pressure roller or similar. To\\nachieve tightly sealed joints the laps must also be rolled down firmly with a pressure roller (silicone\\nroller) or by applying pressure. The air vapour control layer is to be sealed to the abutment at the\\nperimeter of the roof and around all penetrations. The surface of the abutment should be smooth\\nenough to allow an adequate airtight seal of the air vapour control layer. Sarnavap HD SA can be used\\nas a temporary waterproofing layer for up to 4 weeks in accordance with the Product Data Sheet.\\nWhen using as a temporary waterproofing layer for a prolonged period prime the substrate using\\nSarnafil Spray Applied Primer 610 or SikaRoof® Primer-600 UK. Minimum application temperatures\\nquoted in the Product Data Sheets should always be adhered to. Temporary localised arrangements for\\nheating the substrate and/or the surface of the membrane with the use of warm air equipment is\\nacceptable to keep the application surface at a reasonable working temperature - provided always that\\nthe methodology and equipment used do not heat the surface or material excessively and importantly\\nare acceptable to the client for use in the area. Careful consideration should be given to the use of any\\nhot works and this should only be adopted where no other option exists with the work conducted in\\naccordance with regulatory requirements and NFRC safe2torch-guidance. .\\n\\n• Side and head laps: All side and end lap seams are formed with an overlap of minimum 80mm by self-\\nadhesion and should be fully supported and continuously sealed all in strict accordance with the\\nProduct Data Sheet..\\n\\n• Upstands, kerbs and other penetrations: Enclose edges of insulation.

For sloping, vertical and detail work a\\nlambswool roller should be used.\\n-  Install Sarnafil peelstops to the perimeter of the roof, at all internal angles of roof detail and\\naround all roof penetrations. Peelstops should be fastened into the structural deck where at all\\npossible. If fixing into upstands, kerbs or other substrates, ensure these are suitably fixed to the\\nstructure. Fix at maximum 250mm centres with appropriate thermally broken SBT screw fasteners. If  \\nfixing into alternative substrates please consult the Sika Roofing Technical Services Department\\n-  Sarnafil thermally broken fasteners must be installed with the appropriate tooling and the\\nmembrane must be pre-punched with the Sarnafil SMP tool.\\n-  When adhering G410-EL (non-fleece backed) membrane over insulation boards or\\nplywood/OSB decking, if the joints are not level, it is possible that they will be seen ghosting through\\nthe membrane. This may be more pronounced on refurbishment projects where the existing\\nwaterproofing is being overlaid.\\n-  To reduce this effect, a membrane with an integral fleece (G410-ELF) should be used.\\n-  When using Sarnafil G/S membranes >1.5mm thick or all Sarnafil TG/TS membranes, prior to\\nwelding, it is essential to chamfer the leading edge of all transverse/cross joints in accordance with the\\nrecommendations for Sarnafil systems.\\n-  Do not wrinkle or stretch. When adhering Sarnafil membranes with Sarnacol 2170 over\\nSikatherm® MW (DD)/Rockwool Hardrock Multi-Fix insulation, apply 2no. primer coats of adhesive on\\nthe insulation board and allow to dry, before applying a further coat of adhesive to the back of the\\nmembrane.\\n·  Detailing Membrane:  All detail work flashings are to be carried out using Sarnafil G410-15EL\\nLight Grey and/or S327-15EL Light Grey membrane.\\n·  Fastener Guidance:  Due to the Guarantee specified on this project, for fixing into new decks or\\n\\nProject No: 20-033\\nProject:\\nFenlake House & Fujifilm House\\nNote:\\nAll products within this NBS\\nSpecification can be considered\\nfor substitution.\\nBut any alternatives will need to\\nbe appoved by both the PM and\\nBCRi prior to order.\\n\\nRevision : T2B C R  I N F I N I T Y\\nA R C H I T E C T S\\n\\nJ42 Page 10  of  12\\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\n\\n\\nupstands where Sarnafil thermally broken SBT tube fasteners cannot be used, Sarnafil stainless steel\\nfasteners will be required.\\n·  Surface condition at completion: Fully sealed, smooth, weatherproof and free draining. .\\n- Do not wrinkle or stretch.\\n\\n• Surface condition at completion: Fully sealed, smooth, weatherproof and free draining.\\n\\n730 WELDED JOINTING OF WATERPROOF MEMBRANE\\n• Side and end joints:\\n\\n- Laps (minimum): 80mm..\\n- Preparation: Clean and dry surfaces beyond full width of joint.\\n- Sealing: Weld together.\\n\\n• Seam sealant: Not required.\\n• Condition at completion: Fully sealed, smooth, weatherproof and free draining.\\n\\n760 PERIMETER OF MEMBRANE\\n• General: Secure membrane at roof edge condi ons, changes of plane, curb flashings, upstands to roof \\n\\nlights, etc. with mechanical fasteners.\\n\\n765 PERIMETER DETAILS FOR THERMOPLASTIC MEMBRANES\\n• Upstands, edge trims, drips, kerbs, etc.: Secure preformed metal sections to roof structure with\\n\\nmechanical fasteners.\\n• Roof membrane: Dress over perimeter profile.

PERFORMANCE, DESIGN AND APPROVALS \\n\\nINFORMATION \\n\\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n\\nINTRODUCTION \\n\\nThe new building is to comprise a 3-storey office development for the site known as Fenlake \\n\\nHouse. It is to be energy efficient and secure, simple to operate at a basic level and built to \\n\\nhigh standards of workmanship with high quality materials. \\n\\nThis specification describes the scope of the vertical transport systems and sets out the \\n\\nperformance required for the systems in operation, the Vertical Transport System Specialist \\n\\nis responsible for designing, supplying, installing, testing and commissioning all the services \\n\\nas required for a fully operational lift(s) as detailed within this specification. \\n\\n \\n\\nTHE SPECIFICATION \\n\\nThis specification require compliance with Statutory legislation and recognised UK standards, \\n\\nsuch as British Standards, CIBSE, BSRIA, BESA and Approved Documents for Building \\n\\nRegulations, including all ‘tiered’ documents referred to within these standards and guides. \\n\\nThe Specialist Contractor is to utilise these standards on which to base the development of \\n\\nthe design/specification.  \\n\\nPlant and equipment sizes/loads provided in the specification and/or design intent drawings \\n\\nare for information only to assist during the tender stage and may comprise approximations \\n\\nand estimates of such. The Contractor is required to undertake its own detailed design \\n\\ncalculations to satisfy themselves with the equipment proposals. \\n\\nWhen the specification does not provide a specific requirement, or the design or installation \\n\\nrequirements are not covered by any of the quoted standards, the Contractor shall contact the \\n\\nEmployer’s Consultant to agree a solution. \\n\\nTo provide the Contractor with design flexibility, more than one type of material may be \\n\\npermitted for use. However, only one material should be utilised for each element of any given \\n\\nsystem. For example, pipework should be entirely press-fit copper for domestic water services. \\n\\nA mixture of materials in the same system is not acceptable. \\n\\n \\n\\nDESIGN APPROACH AND STRATEGY \\n\\nAll works shall be executed in accordance with; \\n\\na. Any Acts of Parliament and any statutory instruments, rules, orders, regulations, \\n\\nnotices, directions, bye-laws and permissions for the time being made under or \\n\\nderiving validity from any Act of Parliament; \\n\\nb. Any European directive or regulations and rules having the force of law in the United \\n\\nKingdom; and \\n\\nc. Any regulations, orders, byelaws or codes of practice of any local or statutory authority \\n\\nor statutory undertaker having jurisdiction over the Works \\n\\nd. British and/or European Standards and Codes of Practice. \\n\\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 13DDEBB3-C70C-4B6A-BFF5-002ADCF053E7\\n\\nhttp://www.escuk.com/\\nhttp://www.escuk.com/\\n\\n\\nwww.escuk.com \\n\\n1632/ESC/CA/XX/SP/E/0004 \\n\\nESC1632 - PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION FOR VERTICAL TRANSPORT SYSTEMS – T1  \\n\\n19/02/2021 - PROPOSED CAT A OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AT FENLAKE HOUSE - GRAFTONGATE Page 4 of 13 \\n\\n \\n\\nThe principles of ‘best practice’ will be applied wherever possible throughout the design \\n\\nprocess, to provide a facility that balances performance with operational cost.  Best practice \\n\\nshould utilise known technology and modern design and process management techniques to \\n\\nproduce systems that operate within sensible parameters, without excessive margins that \\n\\nresult in over-design and poor performance. \\n\\nThe Mechanical Contractor is entirely responsible for ensuring co-ordination between his \\n\\ninstallation and other services sub-contractors and specialist contractors. \\n\\n \\n\\nDESIGN STANDARDS \\n\\nThe Vertical transportation system will be designed, supplied, installed, tested and \\n\\ncommissioned in accordance with the following standards: \\n\\n• British Standards, where relevant to Vertical Transportation \\n\\n• International Standards, where harmonised with British Standards \\n\\n• BSRIA Guides and Technical Memoranda \\n\\n• Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Design Guides \\n\\n• Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Technical Memoranda \\n\\n• Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers Application Manuals \\n\\n• Building Engineering Services Association \\n\\n• Statutory Regulations and Instruments \\n\\n• EN81-1 Lift Directive – EN81-70 DDA compliant \\n\\n• EN81-20 Safety rules for the construction and installation of lifts.  \\n\\n• EN81-28 Remote communication conformity \\n\\n• EN81-50 Safety rules for the construction and installation of lifts.
